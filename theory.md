### 1. Regular Expressions

Find regexes that match the following. (e.g. find a single regex that matches
both `antelope` and `antelopes`.)

a. Single regex that matches either of these:

    antelope rocks out

    antelopes rock out

    ANSWER:
    antelopes? rocks? out

b. Regex that matches either of:

    goat

    moat

but not:

    boat

    ANSWER:
    [gm]oat

c. Regex that matches dates in YYYY-MM-DD format. (Year can be 1-4 digits, and
month and day can each be 1-2 digits). This does not need to verify the date
is correct (e.g 3333-33-33 can match).

    2000-10-12

    1999-1-20

    1999-01-20

    812-2-10

    ANSWER:
    \d{1,4}-\d{1,2}-\d{1,2}

### 2. State Machines

a. Draw a state machine that corresponds to the following regex:

      ab*c+d?[ef]

Remember the Îµ transition can be used to move between states without
consuming input.

b. Draw a state machine diagram for the lion and label the transition events that
cause state transitions.

    A lion can be sleeping, eating, hunting, or preening.
